# ✅ Setup Complete - Package Names Updated

## 📦 Final Package Names

Your packages now have clean, folder-matching names:

| **Folder** | **Package Name** | **Version** |
|------------|------------------|-------------|
| `tekton-pipeline-renderer/` | `tekton-pipeline-renderer` | 1.0.0 |
| `tekton-vscode/` | `tekton-vscode` | 1.0.0 |

## 🔗 Dependency Structure

```json
// tekton-vscode/package.json
{
  "name": "tekton-vscode",
  "dependencies": {
    "tekton-pipeline-renderer": "file:../tekton-pipeline-renderer"
  }
}
```

## 📁 Lock File Structure

✅ **CORRECT SETUP:**
```
tekton-pipeline-combo/
├── yarn.lock                    ← ONLY lock file (manages all dependencies)
├── tekton-pipeline-renderer/
│   └── package.json
└── tekton-vscode/
    └── package.json
```

## 🚀 Ready Commands

All these should now work:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
yarn install  # ✅ COMPLETED

# Development commands
npm run sample          # Interactive demo app
npm run propagate       # Sync changes (development mode)
npm run propagate:bundle # Bundle for release
npm run test            # Run all tests
npm run build           # Build both packages
npm run ci              # Complete CI pipeline

# Release commands  
npm run vscode:package  # Create .vsix file
npm run npm:publish     # Publish renderer to npm
```

## 🎯 Key Benefits Achieved

- ✅ **Clean package names** matching folder structure
- ✅ **Single yarn.lock** managing all dependencies
- ✅ **No conflicting lock files** in workspaces
- ✅ **Working yarn workspaces** setup
- ✅ **File-based dependency** linking for development
- ✅ **Bundle mode** for self-contained releases

## 🔄 Propagation Modes

### Development Mode: `npm run propagate`
- Uses `file:../tekton-pipeline-renderer` dependency
- Fast, live updates during development

### Bundle Mode: `npm run propagate:bundle`  
- Copies renderer source to `tekton-vscode/src/lib/`
- Creates self-contained extension for distribution

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Always run `yarn install` from the root** - never from individual packages
2. **Never create lock files in workspaces** - they're auto-ignored now
3. **Use `npm run propagate`** after making renderer changes
4. **Use `npm run propagate:bundle`** for release builds

## 🎉 Next Steps

Your unified build system is ready! Start developing:

```bash
# Start the interactive demo
npm run sample

# Make changes in tekton-pipeline-renderer/
# See changes live in the browser
# When ready, propagate to VSCode extension
npm run propagate
```

The package drift problem is **solved**! 🚀
